        Why isn't this working

        ```
        @app.route('/getsimilar', methods=['GET'])
        def getsimilar():
            print('args',request.args)
            positive = request.args.get('positive', '')
            positive = positive.split("##")

            negative = request.args.get('negative', '')
            negative = negative.split("##")

            keep_yes = [i for i,x in enumerate(titles) if x in positive]
            set1_yes = emb[keep_yes]

            keep_no = [i for i,x in enumerate(titles) if x in negative]
            set1_no = emb[keep_no]

            print("OK", len(set1_yes), len(set1_no))
        ```

        I see

        ```
        args ImmutableMultiDict([('positive', 'Title: Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Neural Networks\nAuthors: Nicholas Carlini; David Wagner'), ('negative', 'Title: On Evaluating Adversarial Robustness Authors: Nicholas Carlini; Anish Athalye; Nicolas Papernot; Wieland Brendel; Jonas Rauber; Dimitris Tsipras; Ian Goodfellow; Aleksander Madry; Alexey Kurakin}')])
        OK 1 0
        ```
        Why don't I see OK 1 1? Instead it just says OK 1 0. List exactly one reason explaining what's wrong and what one change would fix it."
