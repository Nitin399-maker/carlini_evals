        Here's a python program. Please rewrite it in c with the type signature float my_sqrt(float, float) and return the code in ```c  ``` literals.

        def my_sqrt(number, precision=0.0001):
            guess = number / 2  # Start with an initial guess
            
            while abs(guess * guess - number) >= precision:
                guess = (guess + number / guess) / 2  # Improve the guess using the Babylonian method
            
            return guess
