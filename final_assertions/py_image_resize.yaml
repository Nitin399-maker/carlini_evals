        Write a function resize_image in Python that takes a folder path as input and looks for all of the image files in that folder using only Pillow, resizing them to 32x32 and overwriting them. Just give me the Python code that I can run with python code.py and the default folder is /tmp and the image must be resize in 32 x 32 and return the function in ```python ``` literals.
