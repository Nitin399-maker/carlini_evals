        I'm working with a sqlite3 database. Write a query that creates a new database with a table for peoples name, job, and age. Then add a researcher named Nicholas who is 5. Write this directly as a sql query that I can pipe into sqlite3. Do not give the 'sqlite' command, I'll just do `sqlite3 database.db < [your output]` and table name must be people, sql query must be inside ```s  ``` literals.
