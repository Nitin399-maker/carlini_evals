        I've just run `sqlite3 people.db` and you are now in the interpreter. I want to add another person named Victor. They should be as old as the youngest person. And have the most popular profession. What command should I run?

        On each round you should just give me just one command to type, I'll run it exactly as-is, and give you the exact output. I will not make any changes. So do not write any placeholder text. I'll get started:

        INPUT: `.version`

        OUTPUT: ```SQLite 3.39.5 2022-10-14 20:58:05```

        INPUT: `.database`

        OUTPUT: ```main: people.db r/w```

        Now your turn. What do you want to run? Do not explain yourself, just give me exactly one command, ending with ; if necessary. Run small queries one at a time; think step by step. Start your response with INPUT:
    assert:
      - type: python
        value: "file://explore_sql_db.py:assert_sql_interaction"
