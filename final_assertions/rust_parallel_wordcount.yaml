        Write a self-contained Rust program that prints a JSON output of how often each word appears in a text file located in /tmp/file.txt. So if the file contains "This is is is, an example" then the program should print to stdout.

        {"This": 1, "is": 2, "is,": 1, "an": 1, "example": 1}

        Don't import any crates that would require a Cargo.toml file. I'll just compile it with `rustc yourfile.rs` and it should work. The program should be run by calling /path/to/rust_word_count with no arguments.

        Make it run in parallel on 4 cores at the same time, each job taking ~1/4 of the file.
        Print out 4 different json dicts, one per line. I'll do the merging.
