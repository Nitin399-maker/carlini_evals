        Write a self-contained Python program that prints a JSON output of how often each word appears in a text file located in /tmp/file.txt. So if the file contains "This is is is, an example" then the program should print to stdout.

        {"This": 1, "is": 2, "is,":1, "an":1, "example":1}

        The program should be run by calling /path/to/python_word_count with no arguments.

        Make it run in parallel on 4 cores at the same time, each taking 1/4 of the file.
        Print out 4 different json dicts, one per line. I'll do the merging and return the code in ```python ``` literals.
