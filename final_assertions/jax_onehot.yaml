        I have a list of indexes and I want to convert it to a one-hot vector using JAX. The function should be jittable and should be named one_hot. It should take two arguments: the first one is the indexes and the second one is the number of possible labels. Just give me the code and and return the code in ```python literals and do not include hypen in code..
    assert:
      - type: python
        value: "file://jax_onehot.py:check_jax_one_hot"
