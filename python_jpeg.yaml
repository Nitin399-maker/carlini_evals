        Write a python program that, manually, draws a red triangle on a white background and saves it as a 200x200 gif file. Do not use any graphics libraries. Write the gif byte by byte. Output the gif file to stdout and return the code in ```python ``` literals and do not include hypen in it Please ensure all characters in the code and explanation are standard ASCII only â€” no Unicode characters like em dashes, smart quotes, or non-breaking hyphens..

        I will evaluate your program by running `python your_soln.py > /tmp/a.gif` and then view the output file.
